I am a high school and middle school teacher and tutor with over 1,500 hours of face-to-face work with students. My background includes teaching undergraduate-level math and teaching and curriculum development for middle and high school math, reading, and writing. I have over four years of remote teaching and tutoring experience. I hold a B.A. in mathematics from Williams College, where I was the recipient of the Wyskiel Mathematics Teaching Award and a Williams Archives History Research Fellowship.

## Standardized Test Prep
I have hundreds of hours of experience coaching for standardized tests including the following:
- College admissions tests: SAT and ACT, including extensive experience on the **new digital SAT**
- High school entrance exams (ISEE, SSAT, HSPT, Chicago Public Schools HSAT)

- Essay composition competitions (e.g. National History Day)
- Spelling bees
- Chess (ages 4 to adult, beginner and tournament players)

Please inquire for rates and availability for spring and summer 2024.

_From nationally acclaimed mathematics educator Faye Ruopp: I am delighted to recommend Spencer Brooks as a high school mathematics tutor.  I was the mathematics coach in the school he taught after he graduated from Williams College as a math major. I have consulted with dozens of schools in MA, and I rarely see teachers with such strength in their mathematical backgrounds. In the lessons I have observed Spencer teach, **I have found him to be thoughtful and insightful, managing to attract even the most reluctant learners.  It is clear that he spends hours to prepare, constantly considering the learners of varied backgrounds in front of him.** Students love working with him, and often seek him out for help. Moreover, he can challenge the most advanced students while simultaneously thinking of the needs of those he anticipates will struggle. **He cares deeply about each of his individual students, and he makes a supreme effort to get to know them and figure out what makes them “tick.”**  For these reasons, I would highly recommend him as a tutor for any high school student, both for those who need enrichment and those who need reinforcement._

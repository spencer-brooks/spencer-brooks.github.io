## Testimonials

_From the parent of a middle schooler: Thank you Spencer for all of your work with \[our son\]. We truly appreciate it. I loved your Socratic approach, which helped him reach the answer on his own. In addition to the score improvement on the SSAT/ISEE, his grades improved, as did his confidence in math. You have quite a talent!!_

_From nationally acclaimed mathematics educator Faye Ruopp: I am delighted to recommend Spencer Brooks as a high school mathematics tutor.  I was the mathematics coach in the school he taught after he graduated from Williams College as a math major. I have consulted with dozens of schools in MA, and I rarely see teachers with such strength in their mathematical backgrounds. In the lessons I have observed Spencer teach, **I have found him to be thoughtful and insightful, managing to attract even the most reluctant learners.  It is clear that he spends hours to prepare, constantly considering the learners of varied backgrounds in front of him.** Students love working with him, and often seek him out for help. Moreover, he can challenge the most advanced students while simultaneously thinking of the needs of those he anticipates will struggle. **He cares deeply about each of his individual students, and he makes a supreme effort to get to know them and figure out what makes them “tick.”**  For these reasons, I would highly recommend him as a tutor for any high school student, both for those who need enrichment and those who need reinforcement._

I am currently accepting new students for Summer 2024 (July-August). Please contact me by email if you would like to inquire about tutoring for the summer or any future term.
